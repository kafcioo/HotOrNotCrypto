v2 now allows users to add a comment to each vote and displays them in more details section of a project. 
Also, I'm working on a mechanism to check the previous transaction of the sender, and allow address with previous transaction history to vote.
There is also works on escrow some eth with each vote for a certain amount of the time. All this is to further validate that the vote is legit and no fake account are created to shill their projects.
